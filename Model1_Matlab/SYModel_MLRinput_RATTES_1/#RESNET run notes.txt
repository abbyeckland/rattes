#RESNET run notes
-Regenerated ResNet (Hurst et al., 2025) with data from sites Sites_supptable.csv file
--New fields introduced from our sites table into ResNet include: cap1, cap2, capp, PermStorag, yr1, yr2, yrp, Owner,  elev_m (converted from feet), sitename
-During ResNet run, deleted fields: SCA2025, flagHW, flagTerm, Rank. Our code calculates sediment-contributing drainage area every model year, re-ranks dams with select Canadian dams, and uses the general flags field to identify headwater and terminal dams excluding rivers.
-During ResNet run, we retain the following fields and attributes from NHD: SLOPE renamed NHDSLOPE, Pathlength renamed as pathx, QA_MA renamed MAQ_NHDcfs, WBCOMID (from LakeCat, joined to NHD).
-During ResNet run, we retain the following fields and attributes from NID: SA_m2 (surface area converted to square meters)
-Following the site example laid out in Resnet, we ran "SiteTag" for our sites instead of the example "GRanDTag" Resnet includes 
-We renamed the following ResNet fields
